/**
 * Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.
 * In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively.
 * Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity,
 * find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W.
 * You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
 * Note: In case when a user can pick the same time anytime, means infinite supply of the items in the item list, then in teh solution,
 * we will just replace N -1 with N while making the recursive call and dp[i - 1] to dp[i] in the DP approach while inclusion of item
