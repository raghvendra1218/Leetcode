/**
 * Consider a big party where a log register for guestâ€™s entry and exit times is maintained.
 * Find the time at which there are maximum guests in the party. Note that entries in register are not in any order.
 * Example :
 *
 * Input: arrl[] = {1, 2, 9, 5, 5}
 *        exit[] = {4, 5, 12, 9, 12}
 * First guest in array arrives at 1 and leaves at 4,
 * second guest arrives at 2 and leaves at 5, and so on.
 *
 * Output: 5
 * There are maximum 3 guests at time 5.

/**
 * Approach 1: An Efficient Solution is to use sorting n O(nLogn) time.
 * The idea is to consider all events (all arrivals and exits) in sorted order.
 * Once we have all events in sorted order, we can trace the number of guests at any time keeping track of guests that have arrived,
 * but not exited.
 arr[]  = {1, 2, 10, 5, 5}
 dep[]  = {4, 5, 12, 9, 12}

 Below are all events sorted by time.  Note that in sorting, if two
 events have same time, then arrival is preferred over exit.
